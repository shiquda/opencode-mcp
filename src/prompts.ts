            text: `# OpenCode MCP Best Practices

## 1. First-Time Setup
- Always start with \`opencode_setup\` to check server health and see available providers.
- Use \`opencode_provider_models({providerId: "anthropic"})\` to see which models are available.
- Test a provider with \`opencode_provider_test({providerId: "anthropic"})\` if you're unsure it's working.

## 2. Always Specify Provider and Model
CRITICAL: When calling \`opencode_ask\`, \`opencode_reply\`, \`opencode_message_send\`, or \`opencode_message_send_async\`, ALWAYS pass \`providerID\` and \`modelID\`. Without these, the agent may select a default model that returns empty responses.

Good: \`opencode_ask({prompt: "...", providerID: "anthropic", modelID: "claude-sonnet-4-5"})\`
Bad: \`opencode_ask({prompt: "..."})\`

## 3. Choosing the Right Tool

| Task | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Quick question | \`opencode_ask\` | One call, creates session + gets response |
| Multi-turn conversation | \`opencode_ask\` then \`opencode_reply\` | Builds on existing session |
| Complex build task (< 5 min) | \`opencode_ask\` with detailed prompt | Simple, blocks until done |
| Complex build task (5-10 min) | \`opencode_message_send_async\` + \`opencode_wait\` | Better timeout control |
| Very long task (10+ min) | \`opencode_message_send_async\` + periodic \`opencode_session_todo\` | Non-blocking progress checks |

## 4. Writing Good Prompts for OpenCode
The agent works best with structured, specific prompts:
- Specify the tech stack explicitly
- List all features/requirements as bullet points
- Define the project structure you want
- State what tests you expect
- Say "Run npm run build and fix any errors" at the end

## 5. Monitoring Long-Running Tasks
- \`opencode_session_todo\` — see the agent's internal checklist (cheapest check)
- \`opencode_wait\` — block until done, but has a timeout
- \`opencode_conversation\` — see full message history (expensive, lots of tokens)
- \`opencode_review_changes\` — see all file diffs (use after task completes)

## 6. Error Recovery
- If a session fails, use \`opencode_reply\` to give the agent the error and ask it to fix
- If the server is unreachable, call \`opencode_setup\` to diagnose
- If auth fails, use \`opencode_auth_set\` to update API keys
- If a session is stuck, use \`opencode_session_abort\` then retry

## 7. Tool Annotations
Tools are annotated with behavior hints:
- \`readOnlyHint: true\` — safe, doesn't change anything (setup, status, find, review)
- \`destructiveHint: true\` — permanently deletes data (session_delete, instance_dispose)
- No annotation — has side effects but is not destructive (ask, reply, send messages)

## 8. Common Pitfalls
- Don't call \`opencode_conversation\` on active sessions — it's expensive and the response is still being generated
- Don't create new sessions for each message — use \`opencode_reply\` to continue existing ones
- Don't forget the \`directory\` parameter when working with multiple projects
- Don't call \`opencode_instance_dispose\` unless you really want to shut down the server`,

            type: "text" as const,
            text: `Please summarize OpenCode session "${sessionId}".

Steps:
1. Use opencode_session_get to get session metadata
2. Use opencode_conversation with sessionId "${sessionId}" to read the full history
3. Use opencode_review_changes with sessionId "${sessionId}" to see file changes
4. Provide a summary including:
   - What was discussed/requested
   - What actions were taken
   - What files were modified
   - Current status and any remaining work`,
